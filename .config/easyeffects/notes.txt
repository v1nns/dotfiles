I have started using EasyEffects to apply an EQ preset on playback. I did this
just 'cause I wanna enjoy my headphone to the fullest. Based on that, I've got a
EQ made by oratory1990 specific for my headphone model.

To apply this EQ on linux, I had to install EasyEffects
(https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects) using Flatpak :/

And finally, I also created a Systemd service to run it as a background service
after the login.
