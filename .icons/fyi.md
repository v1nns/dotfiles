# Icons pack
I am currently using Dracula icons from https://draculatheme.com/gtk (*check **Icon theme** section*)

*Observations*:

- "**spotify.desktop**" is using its icon from there, so if you don't install this pack at all, or install it\
in a different dir, you must update Spotify's Desktop entry.

- Installed using **LXAppearance**.
